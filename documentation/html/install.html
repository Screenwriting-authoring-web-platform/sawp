<h1>Install</h1>

<ol>
    <li>
        upload everything that is inside the folder /web inside your folder on the webspace where you want the project to be located (most time the root folder /), so when you call http://example.com/index.php the application shows up.
    </li>
    <li>
        make sure that *.php files are executed with php (on most webhosters that is already configured) we tested the application with PHP 5.5.9 (built: Sep  4 2014 06:56:34) on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
    </li>
    <li>
        for better sart url (without entering index.php) make sure index.php is your default file to open (on most webhosters that is already configured)
    </li>
    <li>
        on your webhoster create a new MySQL database(if you can with innodb) (or share a database with another tool, but thats not recommended) and write down hostname (server address), username, password, and databasename. We used MySQL 5.5.38 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
    </li>
    <li>
        open http://example.com in a browser (we tested Firefox 32.0 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS) and press start
    </li>
    <li>
        you can see what php modules are needed for the tool and what files and folders have to be writeable. If a php module is not active(red) install it. If a permission is not writable(red) make sure the php user can write it. If everything is green you can press Next Step.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now you can configure your Mailsettings. If you do not check <b>use smtp</b> then your php sendmail will be used. If sendmail is not working on your server, 
        select <b>use smtp</b> and insert your smtp credentials. They can be from another server or even a freemail provider.<br />
        Mailsettings are important, because activation links and contact form data are send by mail.        
    </li>
    <li>
        enter your MySQL database Serveraddress, Username, Password and Database and press Save.
    </li>
    <li>
        click Next Step
    </li>
    <li>
        you can now create your first useraccount. this account has admin/god/root rights. Enter a valid emailaddress. After register you have to check your mail inpox and click the link on a mail with the subject <b>Verify your Account</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on <b>Administration</b> on the top menu bar and click on <b>settings</b>. Now you can change the settings and press <b>Set</b>
    </li>
